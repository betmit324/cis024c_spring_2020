# Project Details

## Spell-Checker

This is similar to the spell checker project that you had worked in on an earlier project.

The goal of the project is to spell-check a paragraph and provide the user with the correct spellings.

Example:

User enters:

Jack and Jill wen up th ill

Computer provides

Jack and Jill went up the hill

## Scrabble

Scrabble is a game that involves the user forming words from letters that are handed out.

The scrabble project includes much of the template code that is required for the project. You will need to implement the main functionality to get the program to work.


## Twitter Analysis

Twitter analysis project involves a program that allows the user to provide tags to search and the twitter program searching for the necessary tags. The program must use creative ways of leveraging Python graphing libraries in order to graph the results. 

Example:

Enter search term: covid-19

Program retrieves related tweets and organizes the tweets so that it can display time-based count of covid-19 mentions.
